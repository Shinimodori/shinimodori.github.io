We were staying at some random town.

The inn's a little better than our usuals, and even has decent soundproofing.
She and I were sitting next to each other having a chat.

「I am... a demon」

She said as she looks away from me, with a face that's close to tears.

「I'm sorry to have kept it from you... I.. I couldn't bring myself to tell you, thinking that you'll start hating me...」

Her body is shivering slightly. She has been visibly anxious from the moment she told me that she has something to tell me, right until we reached this point in time.

「I'm the demon of the Kingdom of Halzion, well, currently it's called the Kingdom of Gradio, but I was the royal princess there」

「When the current king, Felix Gradio, took the throne, I'm supposed to marry him. However, that man is very battle-hungry, entirely different from my father, the former king」

She was tearing up as she reminiscing about the past.

「I didn't want to marry him, so I ran... My father, mother, maids and butlets who helped in my escape... they were all killed by Felix...」

She said tearfully with a muffled voice as she covered her mouth.

「I escaped with my life... But I lost the will to live in the process...」

「This life was saved by my family, by everyone, which is why I've been alive until now. But still, I've had many thoughts of simply giving up and dying」

「However──」

She lifted her head, and looked straight at me with her tear-filled face.

「──Meeting you... Surviving, and having fun... I've refound the meaning of life」      

She laid onto me, burying her face into my chest, and said while weeping.

「I... I love you...! Is it possible, for a demon like me, to be by your side?」

Those words of love, and much like a weeping child, desperately begging one as to 「don't abandon me」.

I gently hugged her, and spoke in a reassuring tone to her.

「I... I knew you're a demon」

「Ehhhh...?」

When she heard that, she lifted her head and looked at me as I looked back at her.

「When we fought against the monsters last time, I saw your eyes turning red」

「Is that so...」

「So, it doesn't matter to me that you're a demon. I've always, always love you——Irene Halzion」

I looked straight into her eyes, and gently wiped away her tears. 

「Eric...!」

Irene movingly put her arms around my back and tightly squeezed at me. I responded by hugging her strongly, not giving any chance for her to leave.

「I'm so glad to have met you...! I'm really really glad...!」

「Me too... Same as you, I've lost the will to live on before meeting you. And that is why, I will definitely protect you, I never want to lose you, never again」

![Eric and Irene from Volume 1](/img/posts/ch-21.jpg)

She stared into my eyes as she slowly relaxed her hug. That stunningly beautiful face came into my vision. Looking at those teary eyes, she desired me──and me, her, as we brought our faces closer to each other.

「Eric...」

「Irene...」

Our lips gradually closes the distance──

「Hmm...?」

I felt dazzling for some reason as I opened my eyes.

I blinked several times to avoid my heavy eyes from closing back up.

Wait...Where is this?
Until a while ago, I was at the inn with Irene...

And then it hit me, that was all a dream. I carried my body and looked around, realizing I've been sleeping on the bed in my room. 

Umm...was my body this heavy? Did I really trained that much?

As I searched through my memory... I was reminded of my fight with Felix.

Right, I fought with that man and won.
Does this mean that I've been unconscious since then and had been sleeping until now...

And the sun was shining straight into my room, which caused my dazzles.
I felt nostalgic when thinking about the long-awaited dream I just had.

That was the first time I kissed Irene in my past life. Speaking of, why not just let me finish the kiss if you're going to show it to me!

I was a little irritated──and then it hit me.

The future, will now be different from that of my past life.
Previously, Felix became king, and Irene had to escape from her marriage, which was what led to our meeting.

But now that Felix is dead, Irene has no reason to escape from her country, and the future where the two of us meet is no more.

I felt a little.. No, I felt very lonely, but I still keep on convincing myself that this is right. I have removed the reason for Irene to shed those mournful tears.

Even if that makes it impossible for the two of us to meet... I have no regrets.

Oh who am I kidding, I feel like shit.
Impossible for us to meet? No way I'd accept that.

Killing Felix doesn't prevent the two of us to meet, it just won't revolves into our original meeting.
As long as I know that Irene is in the Kingdom of Halzion, there will always be a chance.

I will definitely go see her.
Because I am still very much in love with Irene.

◇　◇　◇

> (Irene POV)

I'm very depressed right now.

I lie on the palace bed, angrily trying to fall asleep.
I know this isn't what a royalty should act, but.. if I don't distract myself, I won't be able to handle it.

This is because I... I had to marry someone I loathed. He's to replace my father on the throne, so he's very strong.

He fought with the current king, my father, in a duel and easily obtained victory.
I never thought that there would be someone in the world who could beat the country's strongest... that amazing father of mine.

And once he take the throne, I will have to marry him...

I will admit that he's very strong, however our personalities don't match at all. I definitely could not proceed with it.

I have no idea why he's so battle-hungry. On the contrary, my parents intended to maintain a friendly standing with each country, although that didn't produce much results. 

But I was happy with it. I really like the idea of life without bloodshed.

However, that man intend to declare war on multiple nations as he ascend to the throne. I can't stand marrying such a person...!

I signed as my thoughts went on. As I lay down on the bed, I heard knockings from the door.

「...Yes?」

I sat up from my bed and replied lazily.

「My beloved daughter」

「Father?!」

A low but dignified voice came from the door. 
Realizing that it's father, I jumped off the bed to straighten up my wrinkled clothes and my hair in front of the mirror.

「Fa..Father. Please come in」

I said as I took a breath after cleaning up hastily.
Then the door opened and father came in.  

「Pardon for the sudden intrusion」

「No, it's fine」

Likely due to the mountains of matters to attend to, father looked older than he is.
It's all that man's fault...!

「What is the matter, father?」

「Oh, you might not believe me if it's so sudden...」

He hesitated awhile and then dropped the bombshell.

「Felix, is dead」

「...Eh?」

It took me awhile to understand my father's words.
Even so, I still doubt its authenticity.

「Felix...? Why?」

What the heck? Someone who is even stronger than father, dead?
Don't tell me, is it some sudden illness?

「Felix wanted to take down the Kingdom of Begonia, so he attacked a village that was perfect as the base. However, he was defeated by a young man who lived there」

That Felix... defeated by a human boy? Unbelievable!

「It's probably impossible to retrieve his corpse, but his death is very much confirmed. It's hard for me to believe it as well, but it's the truth」

No way, not in my wildest expectation. That man... dead!

「I'm sorry, Irene」

As I was still in shock and confused by the fact, father apologized to me for some reason.

「Eh, what is the matter, father?」

「I couldn't protect you. Losing to Felix, agreeing to your hand in marriage, among other things. I couldn't do anything... I won't blame you if you hate me for that」

「No! I would never!」

Father willingly take on an unwinnable life-or-death fight without hesitation, all for my sake. How could I ever hate father!

「This might sound like an excuse, but to make up for it, we made an escape plan for you when we found out your intention」

「Eh, this is the first time I've heard of this」

「This is because all of us are ready to die for the plan to succeed. If you found out, you would have never run away and would go along with the marriage for our sake」

Father approached and embraced me while stroking my head.

「It has been very hard for you, I'm sorry. But it's fine now, he's dead」

「Father!」

I can feel that all the axiety and suffering I gathered up till now going away, as tears lined my face.

「I'm so glad! I can continue living with father and mother, with everyone!」

「Ah yes. Until the day you decide to leave, we'll always be by your side」

I uncontrollably start weeping──

My tears finally stopped and I moved away from my father.

「We must give our thanks to the young man of the village. We're been saved by him, albeit indirectly」

That's right, it's all thanks to him for defeating Felix.

「What is the name of the young man?」

「I don't know, but I've ordered my subordinates to look into it」

「If it's possible, I would like to thank him in person」

One day, one day I'll convey my unending gratitude to this as-yet-unknown, incredibly strong person.
