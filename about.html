<p>I fell in love with the amazingly drawn manga adaptation and proceeded to read the novel. <s>It seems like the last translation group for the novel has quietly dropped the series, with their last release at Chapter 18, which is now behind the manga, so I've decided to pick this up.</s> Luna has graciously picked this up and will be releasing up to Ch.36, so I'll be moving onto Book 2!</p>

<p>I'm not a good translator by any means, in fact, this is the first series I'm doing, so feel free to give feedbacks on improvements and changes. And if you wish to pick up the translation for this series, just <a href="mailto:ShinimodoriTL@gmail.com">let me know!</a></p>

<p>If you're coming from the manga, I would like to point out that there's some notable differences between the manga and the novel, some are for the better, others not so. But I'll leave it up to you to decide which is which!</p>

<p>Please support the authors by buying the books and/or reading them on official sites!</p>

      <dd class="col-sm-9">
        <p style="margin: 0">Eric has had a hard life. At the age of 16, his village was overrun by monsters, who killed his family and friends. He soon became a soldier, but failed to save the life of the woman he loved. In the end, he died on the battlefield, surrounded by the bodies of those who he couldn’t protect.</p>

        <p>When Eric wakes up, he finds himself in a baby’s body. Realizing he has been reincarnated, he quickly wonders what is going on before he gets another shocker: the man and woman who are raising him are in fact his previous life’s parents!</p>

        <p>That’s right - Eric was reincarnated, but as himself. No alternate worlds, no skill trees, just his memories sent back to the moment he popped out of his mother. Armed with the knowledge of his past self, Eric vows to save everyone now that the universe has pushed the reset button for him.</p></dd>
